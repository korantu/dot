** Java runtimes organization
How to organize java runtimes:
Information needed: jvm/jre, version, SR.
One option - jvm/jre-[version]-sr[number]
Sun - jvm/jre-[version]-sun
find ~/work -name javac
** JSSE 1.5 compilation and testing
Verified jsse150.
Copying does not work, let's check the original version.
Original version does work. Replacing separate jars might solve the problem.
Replacing separate class files did not really work, as the jar is objuscated...
Sent failure report to Audrey.
More ideas:
Use classpath.
Make eclipse project and play there.
Put it all into eclipse.

** Setting up general emacs configuration:
 Basic configuration useful on generic emacs install.

Nope.
Instead, going woth Lev,
Accompanying Yulia to spa,
Shopping, then Trying to help Lev fall asleep.
And lot's of time lost.
important finding - 
 Now that I've got this system for storing results reliably - 
  It is visible that loosing them is not the reason for acheiving.
